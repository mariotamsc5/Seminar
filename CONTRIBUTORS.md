   -Knowledge of R programming for data processing and biological data analysis.
  - Good understanding of the overall project to document it effectively.
  - Familiarity with GitHub and version control practices.
  - Ability to synthesize information and present it clearly.

In addition to the above, all contributors were responsible for providing function reference documentation and writing a short user manual using R Markdown explaining to users how the package should be used. When package development was finished, all contributors ensured that it works by using it to analyze the case study dataset.
